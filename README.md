Welcome to the Gesture-controlled-differential-drive-bot Github repository!

This project is focused on controlling a differential drive bot using hand gestures in OpenCV. With the power of computer vision, you can now control your bot with simple hand movements, making the process more intuitive and interactive.

The repository contains all the necessary code and resources required to build and run the project. The code is written in Python and utilizes OpenCV library for computer vision. You will also find a detailed step-by-step guide on how to set up the project and run it on your own bot.

The project is perfect for anyone interested in robotics, computer vision, or simply looking for a fun and interactive way to control their bot. Whether you're a beginner or an expert in the field, the project is easy to set up and modify according to your needs.

So, let's get started and make your bot gesture-controlled!
